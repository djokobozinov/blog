Currently I'm working on Flutter and React Native projects simultaneously. Simple projects without any specific requirements. So I still cannot decide witch one is my favorite.
- Developing in React Native is lot more faster currently for me, cause I'm used to React and TypeScript, because I do web apps in React all the time. And plus is that I can reuse the same code from the web app in many components.
- I like the Flutter ecosystem a lot more, and development experience is lot better for me.
- Also a plus for Flutter(in my opinion), is that Flutter renders all components on its own canvas and React Native transforms JavaScript components into native ones. I like my app to stay the same after the native components updates.
